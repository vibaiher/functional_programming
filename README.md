Functional Programming
----------------------

I'm learning about functional programming and this repo is just the place to maintain all the code I'll write.

## Requirements

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Elixir

- Run `docker-compose build elixir` to prepare elixir environment
- Go to `./elixir/README.md` to see how to use it.
